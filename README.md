# Photo-Gallery
A simple Flask photo-gallery web app so i can look at my target screenshots which I take usually from 'nuclei' easily.

The tree structure should look like this:


<img width="600" alt="1" src="https://github.com/syntaxswindler/Photo-Gallery/assets/98319206/2be94d8a-ca7a-4831-b0b0-74ac6c5d16bc">

All you need to do is save images in a screenshot directory inside 'static' directory. This is NOT A ROBUST APP just something to spin look and then close easily.
